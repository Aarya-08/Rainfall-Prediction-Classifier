### Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

####  Overview
This project predicts whether it will rain on the next day using historical weather data. The problem is treated as a classification task.

####  Dataset
The dataset contains weather-related features such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Pressure
- Rainfall history

####  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

####  Steps Followed
1. Loaded and cleaned weather data
2. Handled missing values
3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Selected relevant features
5. Trained classification models
6. Evaluated model performance

####  Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

####  Results
The model performance was evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.

####  How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially.
